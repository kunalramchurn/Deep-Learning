# Deep-Learning

The repository focuses on implementing several neural networks.

Most calling the APIs from the tensorflow libraries
```
tensorflow.keras.layers
```

Topics:

1. Feed Forward Neural Network/ Perceptron

2. Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)

3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

4. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

5. Transformers Network
